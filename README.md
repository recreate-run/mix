# Mix

We‚Äôre building "claude code" for complex multimodal workflows. It‚Äôs a desktop app that uses existing tools like Blender and Figma. This enables workflows like: ‚Äúgenerate videos and edit videos in blender, generate sound effects and edit in Logic Pro, post process in after-effects‚Äù.  Startups use it to automate marketing video generation, analyzing session recordings etc. The backend can also be embedded into other products via our SDK (coming soon).

üìã Key Features

- Just authenticate with your claude code account ($20 account works) to get started.
- All project data is stores plain text and native media files - absolutely no lock-in.
- The backend is an HTTP server, meaning that the frontend is just one of possible clients. Our SDK with stdio interface (similar to claude code SDK) is launching soon.

## Stack

Quick Install

üì¶ Installation

### Configuration

Analytics tracking is controlled via environment variables:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to enable analytics
2. Set the `POSTHOG_API_KEY` environment variable to your PostHog API key
3. If the API key is not provided, analytics tracking will be disabled

## Configuration

The system requires explicit model configuration for both main and sub-agents.

### Configuration Hierarchy

Mix uses a **global ‚Üí local** configuration hierarchy:

1. **Global config**: `~/.mix.json` - System-wide defaults
2. **Local config**: `./.mix.json` - Project-specific overrides (merges with global)

## Models

- Claude Sonnet 4 as the default model for the agent backbone. Other models might work but they're untested. We recommend authenticating with your claude code code account ($20 plan is enough to get started). You can also use it with an API key.
- Gemini 2.5 flash is used via the multimodal analyzer tool, to analyse images,videos and audio. Please add the API key to the .env

**Important:** API keys must always come from environment variables, never store them in configuration files. The system automatically detects available providers from environment variables and creates the necessary provider configurations.

The system will fail immediately if agents are not configured or required API keys are missing.

## Development

Each project maintains its own build system and dependencies. Refer to the individual README files in each project directory for specific development instructions.

## Development

### Start frontend and backend together with unified logging

```bash
make dev
```

### Separate setup

#### Frontend

```bash
cd mix_tauri_app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

#### Backend

To use in HTTP server mode (to use with the frontend)

```bash
./mix --http-port 8080
```

Use in CLI mode

```bash
./mix -p "Your prompt here"
```

ü§ñ Agentic Coding

This project is optimized for AI-assisted development with integrated tooling and workflows.

**CLAUDE.md**: Contains AI-specific development guidelines that override default behavior.

### Unified Development Environment

- **Shoreman Process Manager**: `scripts/shoreman.sh` runs both frontend and backend simultaneously
- **Auto-reload**: Backend uses Go Air for hot reloading, frontend uses Vite's built-in HMR
- **Unified Logging**: All process output is aggregated with timestamps and color-coded by service
- **Console Log Forwarding**: Browser console logs are forwarded to terminal via `tauri_app/src/vite-console-forward-plugin.ts`

### Development Monitoring

```bash
make tail-log    # View last 100 lines of unified development logs
```

All development output (backend compilation, frontend builds, runtime logs, browser console) flows through a single log file for streamlined AI-assisted debugging.
