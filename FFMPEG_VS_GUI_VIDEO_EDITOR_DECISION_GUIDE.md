# FFmpeg vs GUI Video Editors Decision Guide for AI Agents

## Decision Framework

### Use FFmpeg When:
- Pure automation sufficient - no human input needed
- Single input → single output transformations  
- Batch processing similar files
- Predictable outcomes
- Human oversight adds no value

### Use GUI Video Editors When:
- Human creative input adds value
- Multi-track projects need timeline visualization
- Creative decisions require human judgment
- Human may pause agent execution to take control
- Project files enable human collaboration

## Tool Selection
- **Color grading + human judgment** → DaVinci Resolve
- **Motion graphics + creative decisions** → After Effects  
- **Cross-platform + Python scripting** → Blender
- **Mac workflows + collaboration** → Final Cut Pro
- **Team collaboration + project files** → Premiere Pro

## Human Collaboration

### Agent Pause Points
- Creative positioning ("Is logo placement appealing?")
- Color grading approval ("Match brand standards?")
- Pacing/timing ("Edit flow naturally?")
- Multi-element composition ("Elements balanced?")
- Creative transitions ("Enhance the story?")

### Handoff Signals  
- **"Pause for review"** - Setup complete, needs approval
- **"Creative input needed"** - Decision requires human judgment
- **"Ready for approval"** - Draft complete, review before export
- **"Timeline ready"** - Project structured, human can take control

### Collaboration Benefits
- Timeline visualization for human understanding
- Preserved edit history shows agent decisions  
- Easy human modification without rebuilding
- Iterative agent-human workflow

## Example Decision Cases

### Format Conversion & Basic Editing

<example>
User: Convert this 4K video to 1080p MP4 for web upload
Assistant: I'll convert your video to 1080p MP4 using FFmpeg for fully automated processing.

*Agent executes FFmpeg command: `ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf scale=1920:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset medium output.mp4`*

<reasoning>
FFmpeg was chosen because:
1. Pure automation sufficient - no human input needed
2. Single input to single output transformation
3. Standard operation with predictable results
4. No creative decisions or human judgment required
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Trim the first 30 seconds from this video and extract the audio
Assistant: I'll trim the video and extract audio using FFmpeg for automated processing.

*Agent executes FFmpeg commands to trim video and extract audio in parallel*

<reasoning>
FFmpeg was chosen because:
1. Simple operations with no creative decisions needed
2. User provided exact specifications (30 seconds)
3. Pure automation sufficient - no human oversight required
4. Standard transformations with predictable outcomes
</reasoning>
</example>

### Creative Composition & Multi-Element Videos

<example>
User: Create a product demo video with our logo overlay, background music, and text captions
Assistant: I'll create your product demo using Blender's Python API for multi-element composition with human review checkpoints.

*Agent scripts Blender to:*
- Import product demo footage to timeline
- Add logo overlay with initial positioning
- Sync background music to video timeline  
- Create text captions with timing
- **Pause for review**: "Logo positioning and caption timing ready for approval"

<reasoning>
A GUI video editor was chosen because:
1. Multi-track project benefits from timeline visualization
2. Creative positioning decisions need human judgment (logo placement)
3. Human may want to adjust text timing after seeing draft
4. Project file allows easy human modification and collaboration
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Make a 30-second promotional video combining these 5 clips with smooth transitions
Assistant: I'll create your promotional video using DaVinci Resolve's Python API with human review checkpoints.

*Agent scripts DaVinci Resolve to:*
- Import and arrange 5 clips on timeline
- Add crossfade transitions between clips
- Adjust timing to fit 30-second duration
- **Pause for review**: "Clip sequence and transitions ready for pacing approval"

<reasoning>
A GUI video editor was chosen because:
1. Multi-clip timeline benefits from visual organization
2. Transition quality needs human creative judgment
3. Pacing decisions for promotional content require human input
4. User likely wants to fine-tune timing after seeing the flow
</reasoning>
</example>

### Batch Operations

<example>
User: Convert all these 20 MOV files to MP4 and resize them to 720p
Assistant: I'll use FFmpeg to batch process all your MOV files with full automation.

*Agent creates FFmpeg batch script to process all files in parallel*

<reasoning>
FFmpeg was chosen because:
1. Pure automation across multiple identical operations
2. No creative decisions or human judgment needed per file
3. Identical transformation applied to each file
4. Human oversight adds no value to batch processing
</reasoning>
</example>

### Ambiguous Cases - Context Determines Choice

<example>
User: Add subtitles to this video
Assistant: I'll use Premiere Pro's scripting API to add subtitles with human review for timing and positioning.

*Agent scripts Premiere Pro to:*
- Import video and create subtitle track
- Generate subtitle text elements
- Position subtitles with initial timing
- **Pause for review**: "Subtitle positioning and timing ready for approval"

<reasoning>
A GUI video editor was chosen because:
1. Subtitle timing and positioning need human review
2. Text styling decisions benefit from human judgment
3. Timeline visualization helps human understand subtitle flow
4. Human may want to adjust placement after reviewing readability
Note: If subtitles were pre-timed in SRT format, FFmpeg could be used for simple overlay
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Combine these two videos side by side
Assistant: I'll use After Effects scripting to create a side-by-side layout with human approval for positioning.

*Agent scripts After Effects to:*
- Import both videos
- Create side-by-side composition
- Scale videos to fit layout
- **Pause for review**: "Side-by-side positioning ready for approval"

<reasoning>
A GUI video editor was chosen because:
1. Visual composition needs human creative judgment
2. Aspect ratio and scaling decisions require human review
3. Relative sizing may need adjustment after human sees result
4. Timeline visualization helps human understand the layout
</reasoning>
</example>

### Speed vs Quality Trade-offs

<example>
User: Quick rough cut - just trim these 3 clips and stick them together
Assistant: I'll use FFmpeg to quickly trim and concatenate your clips with full automation.

*Agent executes FFmpeg concat filter for fast processing*

<reasoning>
FFmpeg was chosen because:
1. "Quick rough cut" indicates automation over human refinement
2. Simple operations with no creative decisions needed
3. No positioning, transition, or timing refinement required
4. Pure automation sufficient for basic concatenation
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Create a polished final video with these clips, proper pacing, and professional transitions
Assistant: I'll use Final Cut Pro's scripting API to craft a polished video with human oversight for creative decisions.

*Agent scripts Final Cut Pro to:*
- Import and arrange clips on timeline
- Add initial professional transition presets
- Adjust basic timing and pacing
- **Pause for review**: "Initial edit ready for pacing and transition refinement"

<reasoning>
A professional GUI video editor was chosen because:
1. "Polished final video" requires human creative judgment
2. "Proper pacing" needs human review and timing adjustment  
3. "Professional transitions" benefit from human aesthetic decisions
4. Timeline visualization helps human understand overall flow
5. Project file enables iterative refinement
</reasoning>
</example>

## Red Flags for Wrong Tool Choice

### Don't use FFmpeg when:
- Creative positioning decisions involved
- Multiple elements need human coordination  
- Human judgment adds value
- User might want to "adjust that" after seeing result

### Don't use GUI Video Editors when:
- Pure automation sufficient
- Single-file predictable operations
- Batch processing identical transformations
- No creative decisions required

## AI Agent Decision Tree

```
Does this task benefit from human creative input or oversight?
├─ No → Pure automation sufficient?
│  ├─ Yes → Use FFmpeg (format conversion, batch processing, simple operations)
│  └─ No → Reconsider - complex tasks usually benefit from human input
└─ Yes → Multi-track or multi-element project?
   ├─ Yes → Choose GUI Editor with human collaboration:
   │  ├─ Motion graphics + creative decisions → After Effects (scripted)
   │  ├─ Color grading + human judgment → DaVinci Resolve (Python API)
   │  ├─ Cross-platform + full scripting → Blender (Python)
   │  ├─ Professional workflows + human handoff → Premiere Pro (scripted)
   │  └─ Mac workflows + collaboration → Final Cut Pro (scripted)
   └─ No → Single element but needs human review → GUI Editor with pause points
```

**Key Question**: "Would a human want to pause the agent and make adjustments?" → If yes, use GUI Editor

## Hybrid Workflows

**Preprocessing (FFmpeg):**
- Normalize audio, batch convert formats
- Extract frames, stabilize footage

**Creative Work (GUI Editors):**
- Agent: Setup project, initial edit
- Human: Review and provide direction  
- Agent: Implement feedback

**Finishing (FFmpeg):**
- Compression, multi-format export
- Social media clip extraction

**Typical Flow:**
```
1. FFmpeg: Prep files (automated)
2. GUI Editor: Initial edit → Human review
3. GUI Editor: Implement feedback → Human approval  
4. FFmpeg: Final outputs (automated)
```

**When in doubt:** If user might say "adjust that" → use GUI Editor
