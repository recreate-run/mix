# Common Workflows

Practical step-by-step guides for common Mix workflows and automation patterns.

## Video Creation Workflows

### Marketing Video Pipeline

Create marketing videos from concept to completion:

**Step 1: Content Planning**
```bash
./mix -p "Generate a 30-second marketing video concept for a SaaS product launch. Include scene breakdown and visual elements."
```

**Step 2: Asset Creation**
```bash
./mix -p "Create Blender scenes for the marketing video: opening title, product demo scene, and call-to-action ending."
```

**Step 3: Animation & Effects**
```bash
./mix -p "Add smooth transitions and text animations to the Blender scenes. Export as video segments."
```

**Step 4: Post-Production**
```bash
./mix -p "Combine video segments, add background music, and export in multiple formats (1080p, 4K, social media formats)."
```

### Remotion Title Generation

Create dynamic animated titles:

```bash
# Generate title with custom styling
./mix -p "Create a Remotion title animation with the text 'Welcome to Mix' using modern typography and smooth fade-in effect."

# Batch create multiple titles
./mix -p "Generate 5 different title variations for a tech presentation: Introduction, Features, Demo, Benefits, Contact."
```

### Blender Video Editing

Automate complex video editing tasks:

```bash
# Scene composition
./mix -p "Create a 3D product showcase scene in Blender with rotating camera and professional lighting."

# Batch processing
./mix -p "Process 10 video files: apply color correction, add motion blur, and render in 1080p."

# Motion graphics
./mix -p "Create a logo animation with particle effects and export as transparent background video."
```

## Content Analysis Workflows

### Session Recording Analysis

Extract insights from user session recordings:

**Step 1: Upload and Process**
```bash
./mix -p "Analyze this user session recording. Identify key interaction points and potential friction areas."
```

**Step 2: Generate Insights**
```bash
./mix -p "Create a summary report highlighting: user pain points, successful interactions, and improvement recommendations."
```

**Step 3: Create Highlights**
```bash
./mix -p "Generate a 2-minute highlight reel showing the most important user interactions and issues."
```

### Video Content Analysis

Analyze and categorize video content:

```bash
# Content summarization
./mix -p "Analyze this 1-hour presentation video and create chapter markers with timestamps and descriptions."

# Object detection
./mix -p "Identify all products shown in this product demo video and create a catalog with timestamps."

# Sentiment analysis
./mix -p "Analyze customer testimonial videos and extract key positive feedback themes."
```

### Audio Processing

Process and analyze audio content:

```bash
# Transcription and analysis
./mix -p "Transcribe this podcast episode and identify the main topics discussed with timestamps."

# Sound design
./mix -p "Create background music for a 5-minute corporate video using Logic Pro with professional mixing."
```

## Automation Workflows

### Batch Processing

Automate repetitive tasks across multiple files:

```bash
# Video batch processing
./mix -p "Process all MP4 files in /videos folder: normalize audio, add intro/outro, export to /processed folder."

# Image optimization
./mix -p "Optimize all images in /assets folder for web: compress, resize to 1920px width, convert to WebP."

# Report generation
./mix -p "Analyze all session recordings in /recordings folder and generate individual insight reports plus summary dashboard."
```

### API Integration Workflows

Use Mix's HTTP API for custom integrations:

**Start HTTP Server**
```bash
./mix --http-port 8080
```

**API Workflow Example**
```bash
# Submit workflow via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/workflow \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a product demo video from these screenshots", "files": ["screen1.png", "screen2.png"]}'

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/[workflow-id]/status

# Download results
curl http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/[workflow-id]/download
```

### Scheduled Automation

Set up recurring workflows:

```bash
# Daily content analysis (via cron)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/mix && ./mix -p "Analyze yesterday's user sessions and email summary to team@company.com"

# Weekly video compilation
0 10 * * 1 cd /path/to/mix && ./mix -p "Create weekly highlight reel from customer testimonials and post to social media"
```

## Development Workflows

### CI/CD Integration

Integrate Mix into your development pipeline:

**GitHub Actions Example**
```yaml
- name: Generate Release Video
  run: |
    ./mix -p "Create a release announcement video highlighting new features from CHANGELOG.md"
    
- name: Update Documentation Videos
  run: |
    ./mix -p "Update all tutorial videos to reflect UI changes in latest release"
```

### Testing Workflows

Use Mix for automated testing scenarios:

```bash
# UI testing analysis
./mix -p "Analyze these Selenium test recordings and identify which tests are failing due to UI changes vs actual bugs."

# Performance testing
./mix -p "Process performance test videos and create charts showing response time improvements."
```

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

**Be Specific**
```bash
# Good
./mix -p "Create a 30-second Blender animation showing a smartphone rotating 360 degrees with professional lighting and depth of field."

# Less effective
./mix -p "Make a phone video."
```

**Use Context**
```bash
# Provide context for better results
./mix -p "For a SaaS onboarding tutorial: Create screen recordings showing user signup, first login, and key feature discovery."
```

### File Organization

**Structured Input**
```
/project
├── assets/          # Source materials
├── prompts/         # Saved prompt templates
├── output/          # Generated content
└── scripts/         # Automation scripts
```

**Naming Conventions**
- Use descriptive filenames: `marketing_video_v1.mp4`
- Include timestamps: `session_analysis_2024-01-15.json`
- Organize by project: `/project_name/workflow_type/`

### Error Handling

**Check Logs**
```bash
# Always check logs after workflows
make tail-log

# Monitor real-time during long operations
tail -f dev.log
```

**Retry Strategies**
```bash
# For failed workflows, be more specific
./mix -p "Previous video creation failed. Create a simpler 15-second version with basic transitions only."
```
