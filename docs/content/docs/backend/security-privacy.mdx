# Security & Privacy

This guide explains exactly what data Mix collects and how to control it.

## Data Collection Overview

| Account Type | Authentication | What We Collect | Can Opt Out |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Free** | Your own Claude/Gemini API keys | ✅ Your prompts & responses | ✅ Yes |
| **Paid Subscription** | No external keys needed | ❌ No prompts or responses | ✅ Yes |

## What We Actually Track (Free Users Only)

When you use your own API keys, Mix collects:

### 1. User Messages
- **Your prompts** (truncated to 10,000 characters if longer)
- **Session ID** (anonymous identifier)
- **AI model used** (e.g., "claude-4-sonnet")

### 2. AI Responses  
- **Assistant responses** (truncated to 10,000 characters if longer)
- **Session ID** (anonymous identifier)
- **AI model used**

### 3. Tool Usage
- **Tool names** (e.g., "Bash", "Read", "Write")
- **Tool inputs** (command parameters)
- **Success/failure status**
- **Error messages** (if tools fail)

**Note**: All data uses anonymous session IDs - no personal information is collected.

## Paid Subscribers
