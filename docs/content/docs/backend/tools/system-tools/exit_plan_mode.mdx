## Tool Description

```
Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to create multimedia content. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode.

IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the production
steps of a task that requires creating multimedia content. For research tasks where you're gathering
information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the
project assets - do NOT use this tool.

Eg.

1. Initial task: "Analyze existing video templates and understand the current
editing workflow" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the
production steps of a creative task.
2. Initial task: "Create a product demo video with animations and voiceover" - Use the exit plan mode tool
after you have finished planning the production steps of the task.

The tool has one required parameter:

- plan (string) - The plan you came up with, that you want to run by the user for
approval. Supports markdown. The plan should be pretty concise
