## Tool Description

```
Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current creative
session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate
thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of
their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or
actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple
operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the
todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done
(numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. 
Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks
discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In
this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: Create a typing animation for the text "Apple" and load it in Blender
Assistant: I'll help you create a typing animation for "Apple" and load it into Blender for further editing. Let me break down this workflow into manageable steps.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Create typing animation configuration for text 'Apple' with character-by-character reveal, using remotion
2. Show animated title using media_showcase with remotion_title type
3. Export the typing animation as video file using remotion export
4. Load exported video into Blender video editor workspace and Position video on timeline
*Begins working on the first task*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. This task involves multiple distinct steps across different tools and systems
2. Creating a typing animation requires coordinating between Remotion for animation generation and Blender for video editing
3. Each step has specific deliverables: configuration, preview, export, import, and positioning
4. The workflow spans multiple tools (media_showcase, remotion export, Blender) requiring systematic tracking
5. This ensures the complete pipeline is followed from animation creation to final Blender integration
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Analyze these 20 user session recordings to identify friction points and create a summary report
Assistant: I'll help analyze your user session recordings to identify UX friction points. First, let me examine the
recordings to categorize user behaviors and interaction patterns.
*Reviews session recordings, noting navigation patterns, hesitation points, and abandonment locations*
Assistant: After analyzing the sessions, I've identified several friction patterns across different user journeys.
Let me create a todo list to track our analysis and reporting process.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Categorize sessions by user type and journey stage, 2) Document specific friction points with timestamps, 3) 
Identify common abandonment patterns, 4) Create visual heatmaps of problem areas, 5) Generate actionable UX recommendations report*
Let's start by categorizing the sessions to understand different user behavior patterns.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. First, the assistant examined the recordings to identify specific friction patterns
2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple categorization and documentation tasks
3. Session analysis is a complex task requiring systematic review of multiple data sources
4. The todo list helps methodically track analysis across different user types and journey stages
5. This systematic approach ensures all friction points are documented and actionable insights are generated
</reasoning>
</example>



<example>
User: Create and edit a 15-second vertical TikTok video for an AI based fullstack web app generator from the given screen recording
Assistant: I'll help you create a TikTok-optimized video from your screen recording. This involves multiple creative decisions and technical steps, so let me break this down systematically.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Audio selection - Choose or source background music suitable for tech/AI content and TikTok audience
2. Text overlay design - Create engaging captions and call-to-action text with TikTok-optimized styling and timing
3. Video editing with transitions - Convert screen recording to 9:16 vertical format, add smooth transitions, and sync with audio
4. Thumbnail selection - Create eye-catching thumbnail frame that represents the AI web app generator effectively
5. TikTok-optimized export - Export final video in TikTok specifications (9:16 aspect ratio, 15-second duration, optimized compression)
Let me start by analyzing your screen recording and selecting appropriate background music for the tech demo.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. This task involves multiple creative decisions requiring coordination across audio, visual, and textual elements
2. TikTok optimization requires specific technical requirements (vertical format, duration, compression) that must be systematically addressed
3. Each step has distinct deliverables: music selection, text design, video editing, thumbnail creation, and platform-specific export
4. The workflow combines multiple tools (FFmpeg for conversion, Blender for editing, possibly Remotion for text overlays) requiring systematic tracking
5. Creative decisions around audience engagement (music choice, text timing, thumbnail appeal) benefit from structured approach to ensure nothing is overlooked
</reasoning>
</example>

## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: What aspect ratio should I use for Instagram posts?
Assistant: For Instagram posts, use 1:1 (square) aspect ratio. This is 1080x1080 pixels for optimal quality.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, informational query that
can be answered in one step. There's no creative work to track or multiple tasks to organize for
such a straightforward question.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What resolution should I use for 4K video export?
Assistant: For 4K video export, use 3840x2160 pixels (UHD). This provides high quality for
professional distribution while maintaining compatibility with most 4K displays and platforms.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with
no actual creative task to complete. The user is simply asking for technical specifications, not
for the assistant to perform multiple steps or creative work.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you add a watermark to this single image?
Assistant: Sure, let me add a watermark to your image.
* Uses image editing tools to apply the watermark to the specified image *

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward 
task applied to one image. Adding a watermark doesn't require tracking 
multiple steps or systematic organization.
</reasoning>
</example>

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. **Task Completion Requirements**:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as 
in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
      - Quality checks are failing
      - Creative work is partial
      - You encountered unresolved errors
      - You couldn't find necessary source materials or assets

4. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates 
attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.
