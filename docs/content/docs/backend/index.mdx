# Mix Platform Overview

> Mix is "Claude Code" for complex multimodal workflows. A desktop app that integrates with professional tools like Blender, Figma, and Logic Pro to automate creative and analytical workflows.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and start development environment
git clone <repository-url> && cd mix && make dev
```

## What Mix does for you

* **Automate creative workflows**: Generate and edit videos in Blender, create sound effects in Logic Pro, post-process in After Effects - all from natural language descriptions.
* **Analyze multimedia content**: Extract insights from session recordings, analyze video content, and process multimodal data automatically.
* **Integrate professional tools**: Works with existing creative and analytical software you already use - no need to change your workflow.
* **Flexible deployment**: Use as a desktop app or embed the backend into your products via our upcoming SDK with stdio interface (similar to Claude Code SDK).

## Why teams choose Mix

* **No vendor lock-in**: All project data is stored as plain text and native media files. Your data stays yours.
* **Professional tool integration**: Works with Blender, Figma, Logic Pro, After Effects, and other industry-standard software.
* **Powerful AI backbone**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4 for reasoning and Gemini 2.5 Flash for multimodal analysis.
* **HTTP API architecture**: Backend is an HTTP server, meaning the desktop app is just one client. Perfect for integration.

## Architecture Overview

Mix consists of two main components:

- **Go Backend**: HTTP server that orchestrates AI agents and tool integrations
- **Tauri Frontend**: Cross-platform desktop application built with React
- **AI Integration**: Claude Sonnet 4 for main reasoning, Gemini 2.5 Flash for multimodal analysis

## Key Features

### Creative Automation
- **Video Generation & Editing**: Automated Blender workflows for video creation
- **Audio Processing**: Integration with Logic Pro for sound design
- **Visual Design**: Figma integration for design workflows
- **Post-Production**: After Effects automation for final processing

### Analysis & Intelligence  
- **Session Recording Analysis**: Extract insights and highlights from user sessions
- **Multimodal Content Analysis**: Process images, videos, and audio automatically
- **Content Summarization**: Generate summaries and key insights from multimedia content

### Developer Experience
- **Plain Text Storage**: No proprietary formats, complete data portability
- **HTTP API**: RESTful backend ready for custom integrations
- **Unified Development**: Single `make dev` command starts everything
- **Flexible Authentication**: Claude Code account or API keys

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development (starts both frontend and backend)
make dev

# Production build
