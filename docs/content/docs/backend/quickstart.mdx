# Quickstart Guide

Get Mix up and running in 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **[Go 1.19+](https://golang.org/dl/)** - For the backend service
- **[Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** - For the frontend application
- **Git** - To clone the repository

## Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mix

# Start development environment (this starts both frontend and backend)
make dev
```

The `make dev` command will:
- Start the Go backend HTTP server
- Launch the Tauri desktop application 
- Enable auto-reload for development
- Provide unified logging in `dev.log`

## Step 2: Configure Authentication

Mix requires AI model configuration for both main and sub-agents.

### Option A: Claude Code Account (Recommended)
If you have a Claude Code account ($20 plan works):

```bash
# The system will automatically detect your Claude Code authentication
# No additional setup required
```

### Option B: API Keys
Create a `.mix.json` file in your home directory or project root:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "main": {
      "model": "claude-4-sonnet",
      "maxTokens": 4096
    },
    "sub": {
      "model": "claude-4-sonnet", 
      "maxTokens": 2048
    }
  }
}
```

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# For Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# For Gemini (used for multimodal analysis)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

**Important**: Never store API keys in configuration files - always use environment variables.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Once everything is running, you should see:

1. **Backend logs** indicating the HTTP server is running (typically on port 8080)
2. **Frontend application** launches automatically 
3. **Unified logging** in the terminal showing both frontend and backend activity

Check the logs:
```bash
# View recent logs (last 100 lines)
make tail-log
```

## Step 4: Test Your First Workflow

### Desktop App Mode
1. Open the Mix desktop application (should launch automatically)
2. Try a simple prompt: "Analyze this image and describe what you see"
3. Upload an image and see the multimodal analysis in action

### CLI Mode (Alternative)
```bash
# Test CLI mode
./mix -p "Create a simple video title animation"

# Test HTTP server mode
./mix --http-port 8080
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Development (starts both frontend and backend with auto-reload)
make dev

# Production build
make build

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# View current logs
make tail-log

# CLI usage
./mix -p "Your prompt here"

# HTTP server mode (for integrations)
./mix --http-port 8080
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure Go 1.19+ and Node.js 18+ are installed
- Run `make clean` and try again
- Check that you're in the project root directory

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your Claude Code account is active
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure API keys have sufficient credits/permissions

### Connection Issues
- Check if ports 8080 (backend) are available
- Verify firewall settings allow local connections
- Review logs with `make tail-log`

## Development Notes

- **Auto-reload**: The dev server automatically recompiles and reloads changes
- **Logging**: All output goes to `dev.log` - never manually stop the dev server
- **File storage**: All project data is stored as plain text and native media files
- **No lock-in**: Your data remains portable and accessible outside of Mix
