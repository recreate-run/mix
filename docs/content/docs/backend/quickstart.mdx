# Quickstart Guide

Get Mix up and running in 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide.

Mix is an open-source desktop platform for multimodal AI agents, multimodal claude code, where all project data is stored as plain text and native media files - absolutely no lock-in.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **[Go 1.19+](https://golang.org/dl/)** - For the backend service
- **[Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** - For the frontend application
- **Git** - To clone the repository

## Step 1: Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mix

# Install dependencies first
make install

# Start development environment (this starts both frontend and backend)
make dev
```

The `make dev` command will:
- Start the Go backend HTTP server (typically on port 8080)
- Launch the Tauri desktop application (`mix_tauri_app/`)
- Enable auto-reload with Go Air for hot reloading
- Provide unified logging with timestamps and color-coded by service in `dev.log`
- Forward browser console logs to terminal via `mix_tauri_app/src/vite-console-forward-plugin.ts`

## Step 2: Configure Authentication

Mix requires AI model configuration for both main and sub-agents.

### Option A: Claude Code Account (Recommended)
If you have a Claude Code account:

1. Install and start the application with `make dev`
2. Use the `/login` command in the UI after installation to authenticate
3. The system will automatically detect your Claude Code authentication

### Option B: API Keys
Set your API keys in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Required: Claude Sonnet 4 for main agent
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# Required: Gemini 2.5-flash for analyzing images, videos and audio
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
```

**Configuration Hierarchy**: Mix uses a global â†’ local configuration hierarchy:
1. **Global config**: `~/.mix.json` - System-wide defaults
2. **Local config**: `./.mix.json` - Project-specific overrides (merges with global)

Create a `.mix.json` file for explicit model configuration:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "main": {
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4",
      "maxTokens": 4096
    },
    "sub": {
      "model": "claude-sonnet-4", 
      "maxTokens": 2048
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Once everything is running, you should see:

1. **Backend logs** indicating the HTTP server is running (typically on port 8080)
2. **Frontend application** launches automatically 
3. **Unified logging** in the terminal showing both frontend and backend activity

Check the logs:
```bash
# View recent logs (last 100 lines)
make tail-log
```

All development output (backend compilation, frontend builds, runtime logs, browser console) flows through a single log file for streamlined AI-assisted debugging.

## Step 4: Test Your First Workflow

### Desktop App Mode
1. Open the Mix desktop application (should launch automatically)
2. Try a simple prompt: "Analyze this image and describe what you see"
3. Upload an image and see the multimodal analysis in action

### CLI Mode (Alternative)
```bash
# Test CLI mode
./mix -p "Create a simple video title animation"

# Test HTTP server mode
./mix --http-port 8080
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies first
make install

# Development (starts both frontend and backend with auto-reload)
make dev

# Production build
make build

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# View current logs (last 100 lines)
make tail-log

# CLI usage
./mix -p "Your prompt here"

# HTTP server mode (for integrations)
./mix --http-port 8080
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure Go 1.19+ and Node.js 18+ are installed
- Run `make clean` and try again
- Check that you're in the project root directory

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your Claude Code account is active
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure API keys have sufficient credits/permissions

### Connection Issues
- Check if ports 8080 (backend) are available
- Verify firewall settings allow local connections
- Review logs with `make tail-log`

## Example Use Cases

Mix supports various multimodal workflows:

1. **Creating remotion titles** - Generate animated video titles and graphics
2. **Blender video editing** - Automate 3D modeling and video editing workflows  
3. **Video analysis** - Ask for highlights and insights from video content
4. **Session recording analysis** - Analyze user interactions and behavior

## Available Tools

- **Blender integration** - 3D modeling and animation workflows
- **Pixelmator tools** - Advanced image editing capabilities  
- **Multimodal analyzer** - Process images, videos, and audio with AI

## Development Notes

- **Auto-reload**: Backend uses Go Air for hot reloading, frontend uses Vite's built-in HMR
- **Unified Logging**: All process output is aggregated with timestamps and color-coded by service in `dev.log`
- **File storage**: All project data is stored as plain text and native media files - absolutely no lock-in
- **HTTP Architecture**: The backend is an HTTP server, meaning the frontend is just one of possible clients
